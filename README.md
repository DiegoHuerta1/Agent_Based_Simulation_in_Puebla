# Traffic Simulation in Puebla
An agent-based simulation model created to represent the traffic flow on historic center of Puebla.

It includes the graph information modeling the center as a NetworkX graph, with the spatial position of each node included. The model presents a general agent-based simulation framework for any graph—highly general and customizable, with potential for use in other applications. The model is packaged in Python, so the class can be easily imported and used. Application examples of the model are also provided, both on a simple graph and on the graph of Puebla’s historic center. Additionally, a sample application of the model is included, featuring a statistical analysis of the impact of blocking a street for a certain amount of time.

This project was developed for the Datathon 2024.
